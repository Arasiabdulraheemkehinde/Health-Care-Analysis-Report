## Statement problem
The healthcare system faces increasing patient wait lists, particularly in outpatient services, causing significant delays. This project aims to analyze wait list trends from 2018 to 2021 and propose strategies for improving efficiency and reducing wait times.

## Detailed Insights

### Overall Wait List Trends

#### Yearly Comparison
- The average latest month wait list increased from 640k in the previous year to 709k in the latest year, a 10.78% increase. This trend indicates a growing pressure on healthcare services.

#### Monthly Peaks
- **Day Case:** Peaked at 62k on May 31, 2020. This could be due to a specific event or seasonal demand.
- **Inpatient:** Peaked at 25k on May 31, 2020. Similar reasons as the day case peak might apply.
- **Outpatient:** Peaked at 629k on March 31, 2021. This significant peak suggests a potential backlog or an increase in patient referrals.

### Category-specific Wait Lists
- **Inpatient:** Total of 845k patients, which is significantly lower compared to outpatient and day cases. This suggests that inpatient services are either more efficiently managed or have less demand.
- **Outpatient:** Total of 22M patients, the highest among the categories. This indicates that outpatient services face the most significant challenge in managing wait lists.
- **Day Case:** Total of 2M patients, indicating a moderate level of demand compared to inpatient services but significantly less than outpatient services.

### Wait List by Age and Time Band
- **18 Months+ Wait List:** This group has the highest wait list, indicating a potential delay in providing timely care to long-term patients.
- **Age Range 16-64:** The majority of patients fall within this age range, highlighting the need for effective management of services for the working-age population.

##  Recommendations

### Improving Efficiency and Reducing Wait Times
- **Process Optimization:** Streamline appointment scheduling and patient flow processes to reduce bottlenecks. Implement lean management techniques to identify and eliminate inefficiencies.
- **Telehealth Services:** Expand telehealth options to manage outpatient appointments and follow-ups, reducing the burden on physical facilities and enabling quicker service delivery.
- **Patient Education:** Educate patients on appropriate care pathways and self-care practices to reduce unnecessary visits and manage minor conditions at home.

### Resource and Staff Management
- **Staff Augmentation:** Increase staffing levels during peak times identified from the data analysis to manage the surge in patient numbers effectively.
- Training and Development: Provide continuous training for healthcare staff to improve efficiency and service delivery. Implement cross-training programs to allow staff to support multiple functions during high-demand periods.

### Data-Driven Decision Making
- Predictive Analytics: Utilize predictive analytics to forecast future wait list trends and prepare accordingly. Implement machine learning models to identify patterns and predict peak periods.
- Regular Monitoring: Set up dashboards in Power BI for real-time monitoring of wait lists across different categories and age groups. Use these dashboards to make informed decisions and adjust strategies promptly.

### Patient Prioritization
- Triage Systems: Implement robust triage systems to prioritize patients based on the urgency of their conditions, especially for those aged 18 months and older.
- Special Programs: Develop special programs for managing high-priority groups, such as older adults and those with chronic conditions, to ensure timely access to care.

## Conclusions

The analysis of the healthcare wait list data from 2018 to 2021 reveals a growing trend in patient wait times, with notable peaks in specific months. Outpatient services face the most significant challenges, given the sheer volume of patients compared to inpatient and day cases. The data also underscores the importance of addressing the needs of specific age groups, particularly older adults and the working-age population.

By implementing targeted strategies, such as optimizing processes, expanding telehealth services, and improving resource management, healthcare providers can better manage wait lists and enhance patient care. Regular monitoring and data-driven decision-making are crucial in adapting to changing demands and ensuring efficient service delivery.

These insights, when visualized in Power BI, provide a comprehensive view of the healthcare system's performance, enabling stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and implement effective solutions.
